Inner Factory based on previous simple example based on different coordinates types.

I is simply a nested class within the type it creates. And exists because a nested class can acess the outer class and vice-versa.

So, similar to Factory method, the 'Point' constructor is back set to private.

'Factory' class is nested right away within it's factories nested. This works only with single types.
